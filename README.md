## Overview of the analysis: 
The main purpose of this analysis is to analyse the bike sharing system (citi bike) in NYC and see what we can learn from the data in order to show the investors that the same business model would work in Des Moines and they should invest in implementing the same model.


## Results: 
Below you can see the story points in the Tableau Story using the NYC data:
